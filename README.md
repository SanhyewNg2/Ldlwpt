# Sanhyew's Notebook: "Learning Deep Learning with PyTorch"



## What is this notebook?

This notebook is my recording and refinement on the materials and experiments of deep learning with PyTorch.

Originally I was an Electro-Optics engineer that focuses on camera systems. At that time, my research area was digital image processing including image enhancement, multi-spectral image fusion and so on. I recognized that deep learning is my continuous research direction, so I get into deep learning using Python. 

After a while, after a lot of studies and practices, I thought it is necessary for me  to record and refine all materials and experiments in an organized structure. I think Jupyter notebook is the best recording tool of code execution. A typical sample is the book ["Dive Into Deep Learning"](https://d2l.ai/). This book made my thought solidified.

Every person has his mode and way in doing anything. And I think making his own things makes him clever. This notebook is a result of such thinking.


### Features of this notebook:

* The best writings taken from all available resources (books, documentations, courses, and so on) 
* Better structured (organized) from basic to advanced 
* Continuously updated
